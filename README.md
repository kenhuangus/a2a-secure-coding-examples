# Secure Coding Practices for A2A Applications

This repository provides reference code snippets of secure coding patterns for [Google A2A](https://github.com/google/A2A)applications, following the [Maestro](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2025/02/06/agentic-ai-threat-modeling-framework-maestro) framework. Each example demonstrates how to mitigate common security threats in multi-agent systems. The code snippets are organized by security topic and can be used as a starting point for your own implementation.

## Secure Coding Examples

1. **Input Validation & Sanitization** (`input_validation.py`)
    - Prevents message schema violations and prompt injection by validating and sanitizing message parts.
2. **Output Verification & Content Filtering** (`output_verification.py`)
    - Filters artifacts to prevent leaking sensitive or forbidden content.
3. **Strong Authentication & Authorization** (`authentication_authorization.py`)
    - Uses JWT and environment-based credentials to ensure agent identity and secure operations.
4. **Rate Limiting & Monitoring** (`rate_limiting.py`)
    - Enforces rate limits to protect against DoS and abuse.
5. **Schema Validation** (`schema_validation.py`)
    - Validates message schemas using Pydantic.
6. **Secure State & Cache Management** (`secure_cache.py`)
    - Demonstrates secure, thread-safe cache usage for artifacts and credentials.
7. **Logging & Observability** (`logging_observability.py`)
    - Provides safe logging practices to prevent log injection and improve auditability.
8. **Continuous Auditing & Credential Hygiene** (`credential_hygiene.py`)
    - Shows how to rotate credentials and maintain secure authentication info.

Each file contains example usage. Adapt these patterns to your own A2A systems for improved security.
